# GFMAlerts (GitHub Flavored Markdown Alerts)

Here are the syntaxes of the Alerts for Keyman websites. There are 5 types of GFMAlerts:

## Working with Alerts

The Five Alerts (Note, Tips, Important, Caution, and Warning) are recognized inside the `[! ]`. This should be able to support multiple lines as long as it is continuing from the previous alerts. Please find the examples below.

* One Alert

```md
> [!NOTE] 
> Keyman Facts.

```

* More than one

```md
> [!TIPS] 
> Keyboard layouts are defined with a clear and easy to understand keyboard grammar.
                                                              
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Keyman originally created in 1993 to type Lao on Windows.
> Support new lines.

> [!CAUTION] 
> Keyboard layouts are distributed through an open catalog to all major desktop and mobile platforms.
Continue your Markdown documentation.
> [!WARNING] 
> This is the last GFMAlerts.

```

## Limitation

The Alerts can't recognize the inline content and HTML tags. Please stick to the rules/syntax.

1. Not using the `>`

```md
> [!WARNING] DO NOT do this.        // Only [!Warning] will show up.

> [!WARNING] DO NOT do this.
Second line                
```
Output:

![Limitation-1](./assets/img/gfm-limits-1.png)     

2. Indent the second line

```md
> [!TIPS] DO NOT do this.
    Second line                  

```
Output: 
![Limitation-2](./assets/img/gfm-limits-2.png)

3. Using HTML Tags

```md
> [!IMPORTANT]
> <p>P Tags</p>

```

Output:
![Limitation-3](./assets/img/gfm-limits-3.png)

4. Not completing the Format

```md
> [!TIPS] 
> [!IMPORTANT]              // The Alerts will renders.

> Do NOT do this.           // This line won't appear.
```

Output:
![Limitation-4](./assets/img/gfm-limits-3.png)
